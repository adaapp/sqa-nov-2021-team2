# sqa-nov-2021-team2
SQA module November 2021 - Team 2

Within this project assignment, we are to present a simple but well-tested project.
Our project is based around Ciphers, both encrypting and decrypting. With clear, testable logic involved with such a converter, we have proceeded with multiple ciphers, including Caesar, Vigenere & Keyword Cipher. 

## Live App:
The app is live and deployed, it is being hosted by AWS Amplify here:
[Cipher App](https://cipher.kierancaruana.com/ "Cipher app")

##Selenium Testing Repo:
Selenium needs a separate repo, as it is a separate project. You can find the repo here:
[Cipher App Testing](https://github.com/RandomEDP/sqa-nov-2021-team2-Testing "Cipher app testing")

###Selenium Testing In Action

## Team Process Documentation
### Ceremonies
Within the team, we have regular meetings talking about issues and blockers in the project. This helps the development of the project, due to not having a lot of time. Working Agile, we've sped up the process of planning and reviews to fit within the time frame, but are able to use these communication methods to progress business requirements of the team, the development, testing and deployment.

### PR Review Rules
- PR is going into the development branch, not to mess with the main branch.
- PR needs to be resolved quickly, either with comments to amend or pulled into the development branch.
- PR isn't too long, with few files changed/submitted to allow for an easier and quicker review.
- Coding standards are upheld (refer to lower in this document).
- PR cannot be approved and merged by the same person that created the PR. 

### Definition of Done
The definition is done is a clear checklist for completing user stories within projects. The term "done" means that the particular feature has been developed, fully tested and meets the requirements for the story. A clear test for this is by asking the question: "Would the customer be happy with this being deployed?".

- Unit tests passed
- Code reviewed
- Functional tests with QA are passed
- Issues detected during QA are resolved
- Non-functional UAT testing requirements met
- Issues detected during UAT are resolved
- Blockers, critical and major bugs are fixed
- Acceptance criteria met
- Product Owner accepts the user story

### Types of testing this team will be using


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
